## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Development tool
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) -Typed superset of JavaScript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several JavaScript concepts and best practices, including:

_Event Delegation_: I learned how to efficiently manage events by attaching a single event listener to a parent element and handling interactions dynamically for child elements.
_State Management_: Although I'm still building my expertise, I started to grasp how to manage and track application state effectively, ensuring consistency and predictability.
_Organizing Code_: I explored ways to structure and modularize JavaScript code, making it more maintainable and easier to scale.

This project gave me practical exposure to these concepts, and I look forward to improving and applying them more effectively in future projects.

### Continued development

As I continue my journey in front-end development, there are several areas I plan to focus on and refine in future projects:

_Deepening Understanding of Event Delegation_: While Iâ€™ve started to grasp event delegation, I want to explore more complex scenarios, such as handling dynamically added elements and optimizing event performance.

_Code Organization_: I want to enhance my ability to structure code in a scalable and maintainable way, experimenting with design patterns and best practices for larger projects.

_Advanced CSS Layouts_: I plan to continue mastering CSS Grid and Flexbox, along with responsive design techniques, to build layouts that work seamlessly across devices.

_TypeScript Expertise_: I want to become more proficient in using TypeScript to write safer, more robust code with strong type definitions.

These focus areas will help me refine my skills and contribute to building more efficient, scalable, and maintainable projects.
